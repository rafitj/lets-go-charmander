## Description

*Pokemon Let's Go Charmander!* is a Beat'em Up Game inspired by the Pokemon game series. Players play the role of Charmander
 as he ventures through the many regions of the Pokemon world battling other Pokemon to gain XP and grow. Each round you have
 3 lives and your goal is to use your fire-attack to defeat all the enemies before they defeat you and set you back. Gain 
 as much XP as you can and finish all 3 levels to complete Charmander's epic adventure!
 
 This was made for my CS348 course at UW.
